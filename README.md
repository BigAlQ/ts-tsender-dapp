1. Create a basic react/nextjs application ✅

2. Connect our wallet, with a nicer connect application

3. Implement this function:

```javascript
function airdropERC20(
    address tokenAddress,
    address[] calldata recipients,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    uint256 totalAmount
)
```

[address(a), address(b), address(c)]
[ 100, 200, 300 ]

address(a) -> 100
address(b) -> 200
address(c) -> 300

4. Deploy to fleek
